### MelbDjango School - Lesson Two

Introduction to Django "apps"

---

###  What is a Web Framework?

- Provides structure for your code
- Makes common work trivial
- Lets you focus on the parts unique to your project

Ideally:

1. Protects you from the __DANGEROUS__ things
2. Protects you from the __TEDIOUS__ things

### Creating an "app"

```
    $ ./manage.py startapp entries
    $ tree .
    .
    ├── manage.py
    ├── entries
    │   ├── admin.py
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── migrations
    │   │   └── __init__.py
    │   ├── models.py
    │   ├── tests.py
    │   └── views.py
    └── timetracker
        ├── __init__.py
        ├── settings.py
        ├── tests.py
        ├── urls.py
        └── wsgi.py

```

### Introduction to Databases

What is a Database?

A Collection of data (usually with some structure)

A Database Management System (DBMS) is a program that manages access to and storage of a database

---

### Database Models

- Flat File
- Record
- Hierarchical
- Network
- Key:Value
- Document
- Relational
- Graph

---

### Relational Model

Invented in 1969 by Edgar Codd.

Organises data into relvars (tables) of tuples (rows), which contain attributes (columns).

- Tuples within a relvar are unique
- Tuples have no inherent ordering
- Attributes within a Tuple have no inherent ordering

Each tuple is a statement of truth.

Tuples can express their "relation" to other truths.


---

### Benefits

- Users declare the information to store, and what to retrieve, and the DBMS takes care of storage, retrieval, etc.

- Removes replication of data, avoiding "update anomalies"

- Data integrity is enforced by the DBMS, not the application

- The DBMS' configuration is managed the same way as your own data

### Models

models.py

```
    from django.db import models

    # Create your models here.
```

---

```
    from django.db import models

    # Create your models here.
    class Entry(models.Model):
        start = models.DateTimeField()
        stop = models.DateTimeField()
        client = models.CharField()
        project = models.CharField()
        description = models.CharField()

```

---

```
    from django.db import models

    from django.utils import timezone

    # Create your models here.
    class Entry(models.Model):
        start = models.DateTimeField(default=timezone.now)
        stop = models.DateTimeField(blank=True, null=True)
        client = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        project = models.CharField(max_length=200)
        description = models.CharField(max_length=200)

```

---

```
$ python manage.py makemigrations
Migrations for 'entries':
  0001_initial.py:
    - Create model Entry

```

---

```
$ python manage.py migrate
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, entries, sessions
Running migrations:
  Rendering model states... DONE

```

### Admin

- Built in Database Admin tool
- Creates forms for your database based on your Models

---

### Adding your models

admin.py
```
from django.contrib import admin

# Register your models here.
from . import models

admin.site.register(models.Entry)
```

---

### Let's play!

```
$ python manage.py shell
```
